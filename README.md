# Time-Shooter
This is a 2d shooting game I made using c# and unity.
In the game, when you dont move, the time moves slower. This game mechanic can allow you to dodge bullets and think about your strategy.
This was one of my first projects and It is not very complicated but the game is fun and challenging.
